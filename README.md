## Articles

* Vanevar Bush – [As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) (1945)  
Propose the concept of _memex_ as a collective memory machine, which contains the idea of _hypertext_ in modern Web.
* J. C. R. Licklider – [Man-Computer Symbiosis](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/Licklider.html) (1960)  
Envision a complementary (symbiotic) relationship between humans and computers.
* Douglas Engelbart – [Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework](http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html) (1962)  
Propose that computers to increase the capability of human to solve complex problem. Douglas is famous for inventing the computer mouse.
* Mark Weiser - [The Computer for the 21st Century](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs240e/papers/weiser.pdf) `PDF` (1991)  
Suggest technology should weave into everyday lifes and propose prototypes of Tabs, Pads and Boards. Weiser is considered to be the father of _ubiquitous computing_.
* Hiroshi Ishii et al. - [Radical Atoms](http://web.media.mit.edu/~ishii/RadicalAtoms_REPRINT2.pdf) `PDF` (2012)  
Envision future materials being dynamic and can transform into different shapes like physical pixels. Hiroshi Ishii is a pioneer in _tangible user interface_.


## Talks

* Bret Victor - [Media for Thinking the Unthinkable](https://vimeo.com/67076984) `Vimeo` (39:32) 2013  
The media like written words, graphics, computer systems are helping us to think beyond the unthinkable. Bret developed several works to demonstrate the idea.
* Bret Victor - [The Humane Representation of Thought](https://vimeo.com/115154289) `Vimeo` (56:22) 2014  
Suggest we develop _real_ interfaces that use more of our senses other than visual.
* Hiroshi Ishii - [Vision Driven Beyond Tangible Bits…](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm5WCScGKxsi)  `YouTube` (18:44) 2014  
A walkthrough of the works of [Tangible Media Group](http://tangible.media.mit.edu/) directed by Prof. Hiroshi Ishii at MIT Media Lab and present the idea of Radical Atoms.
* Patrick Baudisch - [Personal Fabrication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTKTCAjWa2I) `YouTube` (49:42) 2015  
New revolution will happen in personal fabrication as the resolution and speed increase. [Hasso-Plattner-Institut HCI Lab](https://hpi.de/baudisch/projects.html) lead by Prof. Patrick Baudisch has a series of works focusing on interaction of fabrication.
*  Ivan Poupyrev - [Making Everything Interactive or Why Physical World is the Next Frontier for Interaction Technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlKCPCgq8mo) `YouTube` (1:09:44) 2016  
Making the whole world touch sensable. [Ivan Poupyrev ](http://www.ivanpoupyrev.com/projects/index.php) is a researcher previously at Sony Computer Science Labs and Disney Research. He now works at Google ATAP (Advanced Technology and Projects).
* Jun Rekimoto - [A New You: From Augmented Reality to Augmented Human](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ESVBW7yAyY) `YouTube` (1:01:12) 2016  
How do people _jack in_ other people's senses? Prof. [Jun Rekimoto](https://lab.rekimoto.org/) at University of Tokyo talks about projects on human augmentation.
